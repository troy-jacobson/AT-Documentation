# [AFC_Macro_Vars.cfg] Configuration Overview

The `AFC_Macro_Vars.cfg` file is used to define the macro variables for the AFC-Klipper-Add-On. This file contains a 
set of variables that are used throughout the AFC-Klipper-Add-On to control various aspects of its behavior.

This file is split up into multiple sections, each of which is used to define a specific set of variables. The sections are
defined in the standard `[gcode_macro <macro_name>]` format, where `<macro_name>` is the name of the macro. 
Each section contains a set of variables that are used to control the behavior of the macro.

!!! info

    As a reminder, when a macro is preceded by a `_` (underscore), it is a `hidden` macro. This means that it will not be
    listed in the `Gcode Macro` menu in Fluidd or Mainsail. This is useful for macros that are used internally by the
    AFC-Klipper-Add-On and should not be called directly.

These macros are installed upon installation of the AFC-Klipper-Add-On and are located in the 
`~/printer_data/config/AFC/macros` directory. These macros are **NOT** updated when new software versions are released. 

We recommend that you follow the announcements in the [afc-updates](https://discord.com/channels/1229586267671629945/1318916339674644541) 
channel of the Armored Turtle Discord server for information on when software updates are available. The decision 
was made to not automatically override these macros to prevent any potential issues with user modifications to the 
macros and unexpected behavior.

!!! info
    Travel speeds in this file are defined in mm/s, however typically Klipper expects 
    this to be in mm/min. Our macros have been designed to convert this value to mm/min for you.

## [_AFC_GLOBAL_VARS]

The `_AFC_GLOBAL_VARS` section is used to define the global variables for the AFC-Klipper-Add-On. These variables are
used throughout the AFC provided macros to control various aspects of its behavior. 

``` cfg
[gcode_macro _AFC_GLOBAL_VARS]
description: Global variables used in multiple macros
gcode: # Leave empty

variable_stepper_name                    : 'lane'
variable_travel_speed                    : '120'
variable_z_travel_speed                  : '30'
variable_accel                           : '1000'
variable_disable_skew_correction         : False
variable_verbose                         : '1'
```

-----
=== "variable_stepper_name"
    Default: `'lane'`  
    This is the value that is used to define the lane name for AFC. This should be 
    set to the same value in the `AFC_UnitType_1.cfg` file. 
    
=== "Example"
    When this is set to `'lane'`, all other macros would use the format of `lane1` or `lane2` 
    when interacting with macros. If this was set to, for example, `'leg'`, then the expected
    format would `'leg1'` or `'leg2'`. 

-----
=== "variable_travel_speed"
    Default: `'120'`  
    This is the value that is used to define the travel speed for movement speeds in `mm/s` for
    any AFC gcode macros. 

=== "Example"
    When this is set to `'120'`, all gcode macros would be executed for example with 
    a speed of `G0 X100 F7200` or `G1 X100 F7200`. Remember, we convert this to `mm/min` for you in the format
    of `variable_travel_speed * 60`.

-----
=== "variable_z_travel_speed"
    Default: `'30'`  
    This is the value that is used to define the Z travel speed for movement speeds in `mm/s` for
    any AFC gcode macros. 

=== "Example"
    When this is set to `'30'`, all gcode macros would be executed for example with
    a speed of `G0 Z10 F1800` or `G1 Z10 F1800`. Remember, we convert this to `mm/min` for you in the format
    of `variable_z_travel_speed * 60`.

-----
=== "variable_accel"
    Default: `'2000'`  
    This is the value that is used to define the acceleration for movement speeds in `mm/s` for
    any AFC gcode macros.

=== "Example"
    This value is typically lower than your acceleration that is used on your printer in order to ensure
    accuracy and prevent any issues. This value is usually set by defining a temporary acceleration limit
    such as `SET_VELOCITY_LIMIT ACCEL={variable_accel}`.

-----
=== "variable_disable_skew_correction"
    Default: `False`  
    When True macros will disable and re-enable skew compensation while performing kinematic actions, useful if you took your measurements before loading your skew profiles which may limit where the toolhead can go during print.

=== "Example"
    Your `print_start` macro might set a skew profile correction. In such case the travel of the toolhead may get limited and not reach your filament cutter or brush, etc.
    You may also run into issues with `Move out of range` errors because the requested kinematic moves are out of the defined limits after the correction. A last scenario is that you may not have had the `skew_profile` loaded when taking the measurements so they are offset to what they would be at print time.

    This feature solves these issues by disabling skew_correction before any kinematic move and re-enabling it after the kinematic move.
    
    If you set this to true, make sure you set your skew profile in `print_start` before any AFC/BT macros get called. During setup, take your measurements without the profile set. If you are unsure you can run `GET_CURRENT_SKEW` to see if you have values, if you do, you can clear them by running `SET_SKEW CLEAR=1` before you take any measurements for the depressor, brush, park, etc.

-----
=== "variable_verbose"
    Default: `'1'`  
    This is the value that is used to define the verbosity level for the AFC-Klipper-Add-On macros. 
    This value is used to control the amount of information that is printed to the console 
    during the execution of the macros.

=== "Levels"
    - `0`: No output
    - `1`: Limited output
    - `2`: All output

## [_AFC_CUT_TIP_VARS]

The `_AFC_CUT_TIP_VARS` section is used to define the variables for the AFC-Klipper-Add-On for the `CUT` macro. These 
variables help define items such as locations, speed, and other parameters that are used in the `CUT` macro. 

!!! warning
    These variables **MUST** be set correctly when `tool_cut` is set to `True` in your `AFC.cfg` file.

variable_tool_servo_angle_in      : 0
```

-----
=== "variable_pin_loc_xy"
    Default: `-1, -1`  
    This is the value that is used to define the location of the pin in the X and Y axis. 
    This should be the position of the toolhead where the cutter arm just lightly touches the 
    depressor pin.

    This variable works for most cutter configurations.  If the cutter pin needs to be
    configured in other axis, then comment out this variable and set the axis specific locations.

=== "variable_pin_loc_x"
    Default: `-1`
    Set the X location for the cutter pin if needed.

=== "variable_pin_loc_y"
    Default: `-1`
    Set the Y location for the cutter pin if needed.

=== "variable_pin_loc_z"
    Default: `-1`
    Set the Z location for the cutter pin if needed.

-----
=== "variable_cut_accel"
    Default: `0`  
    Accel during cut. This will overwrite the global accel for this macro. Set to 0 to use global accel

-----
=== "variable_cut_direction"
    Default: `"left"`  
    This is the value that is used to define the direction of the cut move. This should be set to either 
    `left`, `right`, `front`, or `back`.

-----
=== "variable_pin_park_dist"
    Default: `6.0`  
    This is the value that is used to move the toolhead to cut the filament and to create a small safety distance 
    that aids in generating momentum. This distance is in mm.

-----
=== "variable_cut_move_dist"
    Default: `8.5`  
    Position of the toolhead when the cutter is fully compressed. Distance the toolhead needs to travel to compress the 
    cutter arm. To calculate this distance start at the pin_loc_xy position and move your toolhead till the cutter 
    arm is completely compressed. Take 0.5mm off this distance as a buffer. 

=== "Example"
    `pin_loc_x : 9, 310`  fully compressed at 0, 310 set `cut_move_dist` to 8.5

-----
The following variables are used to define the speed of the cutting action.  Note that if the cut speed is too fast, 
the steppers can lose steps. Therefore, for a cut:

- We first make a fast move to accumulate some momentum and get the cut blade to the initial contact with the filament.
- We then make a slow move for the actual cut to happen.
 
-----
=== "variable_cut_fast_move_speed"
    Default: `32`  
    This is the value that is used to define the fast move speed for the cutter. This speed is in `mm/s`.

-----
=== "variable_cut_slow_move_speed"
    Default: `10`  
    This is the value that is used to define the slow move speed for the cutter. This speed is in `mm/s`.

-----
=== "variable_evacuate_speed"
    Default: `150`  
    This is the value that is used to define the evacuation speed for the cutter. This speed is in `mm/s`.

-----
=== "variable_cut_dwell_time"
    Default: `50`  
    This is the value that is used to define the dwell time for the cutter at the cut point. This time is in `ms`.

-----
=== "variable_cut_fast_move_fraction"
    Default: `0.85`  
    This is the value that is used to define the fraction of the cut move that is done at the fast speed. 
    This value should be between `0` and `1`.

-----
=== "variable_extruder_move_speed"
    Default: `25`  
    This is the value that is used to define the speed of the extruder during the cut. This speed is in `mm/s`.

-----
=== "variable_restore_position"
    Default: `False`  
    This is the value that is used to define whether the toolhead returns to the initial position after the cut is 
    complete. 
    This value should be set to `True` or `False`.

=== "variable_post_cut_safe_move"
    Default: `True`
    After the cut is finished, ensure that the next move will not collide with the cutter pin.  A safe move will
    always be performed if restore_position is True.  However, even if the position is not being restored, a safe
    move may still be necessary.  This may be set to False if the next step in a filament change is guaranteed to
    to collide.

    See the section on safe margin/safe location for details on the locataion for the safe move.

-----
=== "variable_retract_length"
    Default: `20`  
    Distance to retract prior to making the cut, this reduces wasted filament but might cause clog if set too large 
    and/or if there are gaps in the hotend assembly. 

!!! note
    This must be less than the distance from the nozzle to the cutter

-----
=== "variable_quick_tip_forming"
    Default: `False`  
    This is the value that is used to define whether the quick tip forming is enabled. This can help prevent 
    clogging of some toolheads by doing a quick tip forming before the cut. 
    This value should be set to `True` or `False`.

-----
=== "variable_cut_count"
    Default: `2`  
    This is the value that is used to define the number of times to run the cut movement.

-----
=== "variable_rip_length"
    Default: `1.0`  
    Distance in mm to retract to aid level decompression. This must be >= 0.

-----
=== "variable_rip_speed"
    Default: `3`  
    Speed in mm/s to retract to aid level decompression. This must be >= 0.

-----
=== "variable_pushback_length"
    Default: `15`  
    Distance in mm to push back the remaining tip from the cold end into the hotend.

!!! note
    This must be less than the `retract_length`.

-----
=== "variable_pushback_dwell_time"
    Default: `20`  
    Time in ms to dwell at the end of the pushback. This is used to allow the filament to cool down before 
    retracting it back into the hotend.

-----

Moves to and from the cut location may result in collisions between the cutter pin and the toolhead.  To prevent this,
an intermediate coordinate can be defined that:
1.  Is always a safe move from the side of the printer with the cutter pin.
2.  Has a direct move to the pin park position.

For pins mounted behind the bed, this safe location is usually in front of the pin park position.

At the start of the cut, if the toolhead starts near the same side of the bed as the cutter pin, the toolhead
will first move to the safe location before moving to the park position.  If the toolhead is elsewhere on the build
place, it will move directly to the park position.

When using the safe location variables, it is only necessary to set the variable(s) for values that are different
from the pin park location.  The safe move will use pin park coordiantes for the remaining coordinates.

For setups that don't require a safe move, comment out all of these variables.

If `restore_position` or `post_cust_safe_move` is set, the cut macro will move to the safe position after the cut is
finished.

=== "variable_safe_margin_xy"
    Default: `0, 30`  
    Define the safe position relative to the pin park coordinates.  The values are always zero or larger.
    The x and y vales are added or subtracted from the pin park to calculate the safe position.  The calculated
    position will always be toward the center of the bed.

=== "variable_safe_loc_x"
    Default: The X coordinate of the pin park location.
    The X coordinate of the safe location.

=== "variable_safe_loc_y"
    Default: The Y coordinate of the pin park location.
    The Y coordinate of the safe location.

=== "variable_safe_loc_z"
    Default: The Z coordinate of the pin park location.
    The Z coordinate of the safe location.

=== "Example"
    A printer that is using a servo and has no obstructed moves should comment out all of these variables:
    ```# variable_safe_margin               : 0,30
    # variable_safe_loc_x                 : -1
    # variable_safe_loc_y                 : -1
    # variable_safe_loc_z                 : -1```

    A CoreXY printer with the cutter pin in the left rear.  The pin location is 13,305, pin park distance is 6.
    The safe position will be 19,275, and the safe move will happen when the toolhead X location is less than or
    equal to 19mm.

    ```variable_safe_margin               : 0,30```

    A bed slinger with a left mounted cutter pin.  The pin location is x=44, z=270.  Pin park distance is 10.
    The safe position will be x=54, z=190.
    ```# variable_safe_margin               : 0,30
    variable_safe_loc_z                 : 190```

-----
Some printers may need a boost of power to complete the cut without skipping steps.

One option is to increase the current for those steppers in printer.cfg. Another option is to use these variables to 
set a current that is only used during the cut motion. Different combinations of kinematics and cutter configurations 
engage different combinations of steppers for that motion. If enabled, the values in the 
`variable_conf_name_stepper_<stepper>` need to match the stepper names in your `printer.cfg` file.

!!! note
    The override is skipped if the current is 0. These are typically enabled if layer shifts occur when cutting.

-----
=== "variable_cut_current_stepper_x"
    Default: `0`  
    This is the value that is used to define the current for the X stepper during the cut. 
    This value should be set to `0` to disable the override.

-----
=== "variable_cut_current_stepper_dual_carriage"
    Default: `0`  
    This is the value that is used to define the current for the dual carriage stepper (2nd x) for an IDEX 
    printer during the cut. 
    This value should be set to `0` to disable the override.

-----
=== "variable_cut_current_stepper_y"
    Default: `0`

    This is the value that is used to define the name of the dual carriage stepper (2nd X) for an IDEX printer in the 
    printer.cfg file. 
    This value should be set to the name of the stepper in your printer.cfg file.

-----
=== "variable_conf_name_stepper_y"

    This is the value that is used to define whether the tool servo is enabled. 
    This value should be set to `True` or `False`.

-----
=== "variable_tool_servo_name"
    Default: `"tool_cut"`  
    This is the value that is used to define the name of the tool servo in the printer.cfg file.

    This is the value that is used to define the angle of the tool servo when it is in. 
    This value should be set to the angle of the servo in degrees.

## [_AFC_POOP_VARS]

The `_AFC_POOP_VARS` section is used to define the variables for the AFC-Klipper-Add-On for the `POOP` macro. These
variables help define items such as locations, speed, and other parameters that are used in the `POOP` macro.

!!! warning
    These variables **MUST** be set correctly when `poop` is set to `True` in your `AFC.cfg` file.

-----
=== "variable_restore_position"
    Default: `False`  
    This is the value that is used to define whether the toolhead returns to the initial position after the purge is

=== "variable_purge_length_modifier"
    Default: `1`  
    This is the value that is used to define the purge length modifier. The slicer values are a bit too wasteful. 
    This value can be tuned to get an optimal purge length. A good starting point is `0.6`. 
    This value should be set to a decimal value between `0` and `1`.

-----
=== "variable_purge_length_addition"
    Default: `0`  
    Length of filament to add after the purge volume. Purge volumes don't always take cutters into account and therefore 
    a swap from red to white might be long enough, but from white to red can be far too short. 
    When should you alter this value:

       INCREASE: When the dark to light swaps are good, but light to dark aren't.  
       DECREASE: When the light to dark swaps are good, but dark to light aren't.

    Don't forget to increase the `purge_length_modifier`.
    This value should be set to a decimal value between `0` and `1`.
